						Hi I'm Odin, a four year old shepard mix of unknown origin. I love chasing squirells and stealing socks. I'm goofy and sweet, but sometimes I get scared when I'm afraid for the safety of my parents and I try to defend them. I was found in a junk yard in the Central Valley, was moved to a shelter in San Francisco, and then was adopted by my parents. That was the best day of my life. I HATE CATS. WOOOF WOOF BARK BARK. Sorry about that. Just saw a cat. I hate them. They are evil and I'm low key afraid of them.
