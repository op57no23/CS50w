### Project 0 -- https://op57no23.github.io/ 

A HTML and CSS only website. Some CSS is generated by SASS and is responsive to media queries. Uses bootstrap, flexbox, and element animation.  

### Project 1 -- https://bookcs50w.herokuapp.com/

A flask app which allows users to search a database of books and to leave reviews for them. It retrieves information from the GoodReads API and has it's own api route. Uses direct SQL commands and implements login and logout manually. Jinja2 used for templating and Bootstrap used for styling and layout. 

### Project 2 -- https://cs50w-chat.herokuapp.com/

A chatroom flask app emulating Slack. Users can create and join channels and send and receive messages in real time. SocketIO used to broadcast messages and channels to all users. Adds an emoji selector from a javascript library. Doesn't work on mobile because of click event handling.

### Project 3 -- [Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/p_M1BPoEJwkjl) 

A django app that implements an online store for a imaginary pizza restaurant. Customers can add items to their shopping cart and checkout with their order. The website admin can alter the menu, see orders come in, and check off completed orders. Uses django ORM database and django''s form models and verification.
